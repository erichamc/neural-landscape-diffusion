# neural-landscape-diffusion

Functions and example notebook associated with the landscape diffusion model developed in Richman et al., Neural landscape diffusion resolves conflicts between needs across time. Nature (2023). Please find the published paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06715-z). This code simulates diffusion on a landscape of neural activity whose depths are shaped by needs. The code provided can be used to simulate the experimental paradigm presented in the paper (Buridan's Assay) as well as optogenetic stimulation experiments.
